# Python-CreditCard

**Introduction:**
This project delves into credit card applications, scrutinizing diverse factors such as gender, age, debt history, and employment duration to assess an applicant's reliability for bank approval. The central question is whether we can predict successful credit card applications using a multivariate business dataset from Quinlan, J. R. The dataset encompasses a mix of integer, real, and categorical variables, including "Gender," "Age," "Debt," "CreditScore," and more. This exploration aims to unravel the complex relationships influencing credit card approval decisions.

**Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- Imported necessary packages, read data from a Google spreadsheet, and cleaned it for analysis.
- Altered categorical column values for better readability.
- Created separate datasets for male and female applicants to examine gender-specific effects on approvals.

**Dataset Split and Summary:**
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Provided comprehensive data summaries, including non-null columns, quantitative variable descriptions, approval statistics by gender, and means of predictor variables.

**Data Visualization:**
- Visualized approvals by gender using bar charts.
- Explored predictor variable distributions through histograms.

**Methods:**
- Planned to train a classification model using various factors to predict credit card approval.
- Considered additional columns, such as the percentage of ethnic groups, to enhance prediction insights.
- Utilized scatter plots, facet functions, bar graphs, or pie charts for detailed relationship visualization and comparisons.

**Expected Outcomes and Significance:**
**Expected Findings:**
- Anticipated uncovering potential biases among ethnicities, genders, and social classes in credit card approvals.
**Impact of Findings:**
- Significance lies in highlighting biases within the approval system, paving the way for improvements that ensure equal opportunities.
**Future Questions:**
- Potential future inquiries include identifying and rectifying biases in credit card approval, improving the system for fairness, assessing the impact of prior debt on approval, and developing predictive tools for approval likelihood.
